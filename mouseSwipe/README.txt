Free to use as you please.

I've had hundreds of replies asking for more functions.
I have been too busy at work to do any changes at all.

Needs to be improved, make it simply. Please, don't make a new plugin with ten thousand lines of code.

Don't intend to buy a touch mouse in the near future.
Better luck next time MS.
